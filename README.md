### What is a kata?

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer improve their skills through practice and repetition

### Which kata are we solving?

We are going to solve the **Coin change kata**

The coin change kata exercise should produce the minimal amount of change for a given amount

For instance, If the input is: $0.99, the output should be: 3 quarters, 2 dimes, and 4 pennies

### 3 Rules of TDD to have in mind for solving the kata

1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test

### Setup the project in eclipse

Import the project as a Gradle project in eclipse

Set as gradle user home directory the directory in where the project has been cloned
